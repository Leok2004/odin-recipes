#odin-recipes

This project, aided by The Odin Project, is an excersize to test all my newfound knowledge of HTML. This basic recipe
website will test my front-end skills of HTMl, such as adding text, links, and images onto my website. I will also test 
my ability to work the back-end of HTML, such as setting the frame for the code.
