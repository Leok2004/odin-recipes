    <p><strong>Prep:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook:</strong> 25 minutes - 40 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Total Time: </strong>30 minutes - 45 minutes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (about 2 &frac12;-pound) beef tri-tip roast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper together in a small bowl. 
            Pat 1 (about 2 1/2-pound) beef tri-tip roast dry with paper towels. If there is any silver skin on the surface, trim it off (here's how). Rub all 
            over with the garlic mixture. The tri-tip can be cooked immediately or transferred to a plate and refrigerated uncovered for up to 8 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF. If the tri-tip has been refrigerated, let it sit out at room temperature while 
            the oven heats.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large oven-safe or cast iron frying pan (at least 12 inches wide) over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the 
            tri-tip smoother-side down and press down on it briefly so it has good contact with the pan. Cook undisturbed until well-browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes.
             Flip the tri-tip.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the tri-tip registers about 125ºF for medium, 
            20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer the tri-tip to a clean cutting board and let rest 10 minutes (tent loosely with aluminum foil if the kitchen is cold). Cut the roast in half at the center point. 
            Cut each half across the grain into slices about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
    </ol>
